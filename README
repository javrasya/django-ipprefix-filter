django-daterange-filter
=====================

Add the option to filter by a custom ip prefix filter on the admin. This allows
to inputs to be used as ip and mask seperately for an ip prefix field.

**IMPORTANT:** this will work with Django 1.4. I won't work with previous Django
versions.

Installation
-----------

Use pip/easy_install

    pip install git+git://github.com/javrasya/django-ipprefix-filter.git


Add ip_filter to settings.INSTALLED_APPS. Then configure your admin:

	from ip_filter.filter import IpMaskFilter

	...

    list_filter = (
	    ...
		('created', IpMaskFilter),
		...
	)
